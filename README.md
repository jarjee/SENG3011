========

This is a project that is being developed by Bradford Lorge, Aimee Lowth, Sam Pollack and Nathan Smyth. The eventual goal of this project is to result in a system that when given relevant market information can then derive a strategy to maximize profits. Now that I have the wank over, I'm going to include our requirements for this project.
