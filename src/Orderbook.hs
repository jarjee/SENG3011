--This will contain the Orderbook simulation code
module Orderbook (processOrderbook) where

processOrderbook = undefined

-- where do we get the orders from?
-- assuming orders come in from somewhere in lists of data types (bid and ask)
-- do we assume they are for one company only?
-- order asks from lowest to highest (i think)
-- order bids from highest to lowest (i think)
-- going to do more research into the process before i write more crap here
