---- Trader ----
* - Currently we do not have share remainders for when we buy. We also should generate valid purchasing orders.
* - We assume that we can always sell what we have bought. We need to keep track of what is being asked for (akin to how the buyer works)
* - Remove the main loop from traderBrain and place it in Main.hs

---- Main ----
* - Ideally the program flow should be taking an item from the 'master' list, feeding it into the orderbook
    and letting the trader access the orderbook global state and the latest+sorted bid/ask entries.
* - The loop should go: Get record -> Submit [TraderTrades] OrderBook -> Submit record OrderBook -> OrderBook newState + tradeResults traderBrain -> repeat

---- OrderBook ----
* - Restructure this module so we can pass in a record and have the tables updated accordingly. Ideally it should work in a way similar
    to how traderBrain works, where we take in an item + currentState and then return the updatedState. This will be holding the 
    sum of all the shares, organized asks and trades which the trader will access.
